# Project Title: Tic Tac Toe Game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Project Description 
Create a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The goal is to have a functioning game that has two players, and goes on for several rounds, ending with a player having two wins before stopping completely. Contains a function to start the game and to reset the board.

## Problems
One of the major problems I had making this was trying to reset the board, and setting up the rounds for the player score to increase. Many attempts at making the board reset have either completely erased the board from the page entirely, or just added a duplicate board that either could be interacted with or couldn't be interacted with. Another issue was trying to do the rounds function. I just did not know how to make it work properly with the code I wrote, and according to other accounts my overall code was very messy and hard to understand, at least at first glance.

Eventually I did manage to make the resetBoard button and function work, but that came with another issue. The green squares that showed the winning combination would not go away, and the buttons STILL weren't clickable. Various trouble shooting has lead to all sorts of additional problems that either caused something to work, but then cause something else to just break completely, causing a lot of frustration.

So overall, for most aspects of the code I overdid it, which resulted in a bunch of messy and hard to understand code, as well as give the function names more adapt names.I also should've used more classes instead of functions, that way I wouldn't have to create a bunch of functions.
